# React Basics in the Components folder

-   ## Topics

-   ### Basic React Form

-   ### Multiple Input React Form

-   ### useRef

    -   to manipulate the objects in the DOM, like an input field or a div

-   ### useReducer

    -   useReducer is used when there is a more complex setup with a Component State

        -   It is not necessary in simple or even compound components generally

    -   it is useful when you do NOT want a Component State to be updated willy nilly, but only when certain conditions are met - it will go through the reducer first to check, before updating State
